# ICDAR2019-ArT-Recognition-Champion-Code

## Introduction

This is the code repository for our algorithm that ranked No.1 on [__ICDAR2019 Robust Reading Challenge on Arbitrary-Shaped Text__](https://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=14&com=introduction) (Latin scripts). 

We hav submitted a detailed technical report to Arxiv that should be announced at Mon, 2 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT. Code will be released by then. Get ready :) We hope our efforts will act as a stepping stone to better recognition algorithms.
